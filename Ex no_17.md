# EX 17 C Program to compare two strings without using strcmp().
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C Program to compare two strings without using strcmp().

## Algorithm
1.Start. 
2.Define a variables. 
3.Write program to compare two strings using nested for loop and if statement. 
4.Read the value using scanf. 
5.Ask the user to make an input. 
6.Print out the answer. 
7.End.  

## Program:
```
/*
 C Program to compare two strings without using strcmp().
Developed by: DEEPASREE S
RegisterNumber: 212222060036

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
 char str1[100], str2[100];
 int i = 0, flag = 0;
 scanf("%s", str1);
 scanf("%s", str2);
 while (str1[i] != '\0' || str2[i] != '\0') {
 if (str1[i] != str2[i]) {
 flag = 1;
 break;
 }
 i++; } 
if (flag == 0) 
printf("Strings are equal.\n");
else
 printf("Strings are not equal.\n");
 return 0;
}  
*/
```

## Output:

<img width="351" height="146" alt="517817057-5a1b20a3-23d6-48e8-92e3-c3e67a513273" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61838aeb-dcc7-45ef-8138-ca33aabaad4b" />


## Result:
Thus the program was executed and the output was verified successfully.
